**Preventive Behavioral Reporting System**

## 1. Problem

Many people, especially women, experience uncomfortable or harassing behavior from others online or in the real world.
When incidents are not considered "serious" or do not constitute a crime, there are often no appropriate tools to report them.
This creates three consequences:

1. **Victims are left alone** and do not know how to share the experience safely and without exposure.
2. **Problematic behavior is not tracked**, leaving room for future escalation.
3. **Other people have no way to know that an individual has already caused discomfort**, and may face the same situation.

The lack of a structured system allows small warning signals to go unnoticed. Yet those signals could prevent more serious incidents.

## 2. Project Goal

Create a simple, secure, and shared platform that allows people to:

- report harassing or inappropriate behavior, even if not "serious";
- do so confidentially, with privacy protection;
- contribute to a prevention network accessible to other potential victims;
- provide a reliability indicator for profiles or users based on aggregated and verified reports.

The project aims for a preventive, not punitive, function:
**intercept weak signals before they become harmful events.**

## 3. Target Audience

- people who use social networks, dating platforms, marketplaces, or online services;
- women who want protection from ambiguous, insidious, or repeated behavior;
- anyone who wants to verify a user's reliability before interacting;
- associations and groups dealing with personal safety.

## 4. Why it's needed

The current digital context lacks intermediate tools between:

- **no reporting**,
- **formal complaint**.

This project introduces an intermediate level of protection: a space to record small but meaningful incidents, reducing the risk they become something more serious.

## 5. Vision

An ecosystem where everyone feels free to share warning signals, contributing to collective safety.
A system that promotes responsibility, transparency, and prevention without stigmatizing or defaming.
